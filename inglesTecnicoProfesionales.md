## <a name="clase3"> 03 - Using specific vocabulary for careers in IT </a>

Hi again,
As I told you we are going to be working in your professional profile.
To do this, we need to know what types of careers are there in the tech world.

There are many different careers in the tech world. If you don't know what you want to do yet, you can answer the following questions to have an idea or a hint about what is it that you want to do.

So answer the following questions:

  + Do you like numbers and logic?
  + Do you like sales, communications and strategy?
  + Do you like to draw and design?
  + Do you like business and social relationships?
  + Do you like projects?
  
Take a minute to answer this questions. You can leave your answers in the discussion board and then we will all revise them together.

Now, if you like logics and numbers probably you can be a _Programmer_ and work in computer science.
If you like sales, communications and strategy you can be a _Marketing Professional_ and work in the _Growth Team_.
If you like to draw and you have a talent for it, you can work in _Design_ or in a _Product Team_.
Also if you like business and social relationships you can be an _Entrepreneur_ and create your own _Start-Up_.
Also if you like projects you can be a _Project Manager_ and work in project areas.

There are different job positions in the tech world.
Here I present you a list of the most commun job positions you can find.

Some of there are: 

  + Designer
  + Marketing professional
  + Growth expert
  + Communications leader
  + Programmer / Dev / Coder (Junior/Senior)
  + CEO - Chief Executive Officer
  + CTO - Chief Technology Officer
  + Frontend programmer
  + Backend programmer
  + UX/UI designer
  + Support expert
  + Business developer
  + Product Manager
  + Project Manager
  + Illustrator
  + Support Professional
  
Here at Platzi we have all this job positions. I just picked some special profiles so you can have an idea of who they are and what they do at Platzi.

The first one is Juan Pablo Rojas. He is the leader of Growth and he specialises in Marketing.
Leonidas Esteban, most of you know him. He is a Frontend developer and he works here in our team.
Tyfis is in charge of communications, so she can be a communications leader.
You know Fredy. Fredy is our CEO.
And Christian is our COO, Cheaf Operations Oficer.
Also we have Sergio Safra who is in charge of Developing Businesses or Buss Dev.

So here you have some of the job positions and profiles that we have here at Platzi, so think about your own position and what is it that you want to achieve in your professional life.

To do this I ask you to answer the following questions.

  + What fields do you like?
  + What is your position in this moment?
  + What do you want to be in the future?
  
I am going to give you my example so you can have a model and then answer in the discussion board.

> I like education, marketing and sales. In this moment I am an education analyst at Platzi. In the future I want to have a job in business education.

So, think about yourself and answer the questions in the discussion board.

Ok! So, remember, your task is to answer the questions that I'll post here.
First:
  + What fields do you like?
  
Second:
  + What is your position at the moment?

And third:
  + What is it that you want to be in the future?
  
Use the model that I posted here with my own answers. This you are going to find in the files section here.
And then you can answer your questions in the discussion board.
Remember that everyone is going to see your answers and I personally will be checking your answers to see if they're correct.

In the next video I am going to tell you how to create your professional profile.
So, I'll see you there.


<br>
<br>
<br>

## <a name="clase4"> 04 - How to create a successful profile? </a>

In this video we are going to learn how to create your professional profile. But to do that you need to realize or identify what are your skills and abilities, what are the things that you can or can't do.

For this I have created three maps. In this map you have the things that you _**can do**_, the things that you _**like to do**_ and the things that you are _**very good at**_.
This information will help you create your professional profile and you will see how.

In my personal case, what are the things that I can do. 
Well, 

I can:

  + teach
  + write
  + create content
  + and many others
  
But this things are not necessarily the things that I like to do, maybe there are other things that I like to do. And this ones are, for example.

I like to:

  + participate in events
  + research
  + work with students or 
  + work with teams
  
Probably I'd like these things, but it doesn't really mean that I'm very good at those things.
So, for these I decided to include this one too.

What are the things that I'm very good at?:

  + writing
  + teaching
  + creating content
  
With this information I am going to be able to create my professional profile.
This is what is going to gide me through my professional description.

And this is what you have to do right now; sit down and in a peace of paper write:

  + the things that you can do;
  + the things that you like to do;
  + the things that you are very good at;

And in the second part of this video I am going to show you how to use this information and put it in your real professional profile.

> ### Task

  + can do;

    - frontend development
    - wordpress sites from scratch
    - find and solve errors

  + the things that you like to do;

    - always learn
    - logic
    - game programming
    - AI

  + the things that you are very good at;

    - project managing
    - find and solve errors



Now that you know the things that you can do, that you like and that you are very good at, you can start working on your professional profile.
Remember that a professional profile is a very short paragraph that describes you as a professional and also as a person.

Here we are going to start by describing you as a professional, so we have some examples:

  + Experienced UX designer
  + Junior frontend programmer/ developer
  + Senior backend developer/ programmer
  + Growth and marketing expert
  + Communications leader
 
And with the vocabulary that we learned in the previous videos you can start thinking about your job position and how to describe it.

In my personal case I am going to be 'an experienced education expert and instructional designer'.

But that is not enough, you need to describe more, give more details.
So here we are complementing that part with more information.

  + Experienced UX designer with deep knoledge on user research and analysis
  + Junior forntend developer with experience in Angular
  + Senior backend developer with extensive experience in Python and Django
  + Growth and marketing expert with experience in creation of inbound and outbound campaigns
  + Communications leader with experience in copy-writing and content marketing strategies
  
So, think about yourself, describe yourself in the position that you are right now and also think about your experience, what is it that you know how to do very well.

Here we have some examples of adjectives that can help you describe your personality, but remember that there are many others that you can find in the files system.

We have:

  + Outgoing
  + Curious
  + Proactive
  + Sociable
  + Goal-Oriented
  + Cheerful
  + and many many others...
  
So with this adjectives you can continue complementing your professional profile.
So, here I show you my professional profile description:

  > Experienced education expert and instructional designer with over 10 years of work in curriculum and pedagogical material design. Outgoing, determined and goal-oriented, very good at working and collaborating with people.
  
In the last part you can recycle the vocabulary that you listed when we did the maps, remember?

After that you are going to include your academic achievements. It's important to include them because many employeers are looking for that information. So, at the end of your description you just include the title that you got.

So, again:

  > Experienced education expert and instructional designer with over 10 years of work in curriculum and pedagogical material design. Outgoing, determined and goal-oriented, very good at working and collaborating with people. Has a Master's Degree in Foreign Language Teaching.
  
If you have more or if you have less, it doesn't matter but is important that you include this information.

Now it's your turn. You are going to write your own professional profile using this as a model for yourself as an example for yourself and recycling all the vocabulary that we have been using througout this lessons.

Leave your professional profile in the discussion board and we all check it so you can identify what mistakes you have and how you can best correct them.

This is just the begining of creating your professional profile.
In the next video I will teach you how to create your CV and how to address the most important things that employeers want to see there.

## Task

  > Junior frontend developer with over 5 years of work in wordpress creating and administering sites and 1 year experience with javascript. Goal-oriented, determined and curious, very good at error solving and testing apps.
  

<br>
<br>
<br>

## <a name="clase5"> 05 - Creating your curriculum vitae </a>

All right, we already have our professional profile created. 
So, here we are going to learn how to create our curriculum vitae.

There are many styles and designs for CVs. You can select the one that you like the most and that adjust better to your style. 

Here we have one example. 
This one is from Chris Walker, he is a photographer, and if you see here he doesn't have a description, but in many others we use this description to give a general overview of who we are as a professionals.

We have a profile, we have education, skills, software, experience and general achievements.

Here we have another one, that is Cesar Hernandez, he is a sales representative. And here as you can see, he has a very short description of himself. Then he uses education, skills, interests, work experience and some references for the possible employers to get some information about him.

The first thing that you need to focus on is your _**experience**_.
In here I show you two examples of the ones that I use in my personal CV.

The first one is a very short and concise example from my experience at Platzi.

```Platzi``` is the company and ```Educational Analyst``` is my job position.
Here I wrote some of the tasks that I develop at Platzi.

The first one; ```Curriculum Design```. 
The second one; ```Create Courses Syllabus```.
And also; ```I worked on designing courses```.

So, as you can see this type of description is very adaptable to this type of CV which is very short and concise.

On the second example you are going to find that is more descriptive.

I also write the company; ```Universidad del Rosario```.
The position, ```Associated Professor```.
And then some of the tasks that I developed.

As you can see, this are longer sentences, which are more descriptive of the tasks that I developed.
You can use either one, but the important thing is that they adapt to this style that you are using.

After this, you are going to need to put your personal information.

```City of Residence```, in my case, Bogota, Colombia.
your ```Telephone number```, this is of course not a real telephone number.
Then your ```facebook account```. Remember that a lot of employers check your social media to check that you are not a psyco.
```Twitter```, and of course, your
```LinkedIn profile```.

After that, you can include your education.
In english is very common to use short names for the programs that you coursed. 

So the first one is Bachelor, BA stands for Bachelor. In this case ```Bachelor in teaching english as a foreign language```.
Then the institution and then when you finished it.
Then MA stands for ```Masters Degree. Masters Degree in foreign Language```.
Again the ```institution``` and the ```year```.
And againg MA in whatever field that is that you are studiying.

It is important to include ```software```. 
Most companies are pending on how capable you are to use different types of software.
Here I put some of the ones that I know how to use and that mayght be useful for the position that I am performing in.

```In Design and Development:```
```Illustrator, Sketch, Adobe XD, Sublime, Atom```

```Marketing and Business:```
```Google Analytics, Google Adwords, Facebook Ads```

```Project Manajement:```
```Slack, Dropbox, Google Suit, Telegram, Timely```

Aditionally you need to include your ```skills```.
Why is it important to describe your skills?

Employeers are going to look for particular things that you can do. In my case I have ```hi skills in teaching```, also in ```participating conferences and events```, in ```curricular design```, project managmement, digital marketing, inbound and outbound, is not as much as the others but I still have this skills; and finally ```writting```.

So think about your skills and assign a score for each one of the skills.
For instance if you are very good at designing you can have five stars or five pluses in your designing skill.

So, make a list of your skills and then score them to see how good you are in this skills.

Now is your turn to start creating your own CV.
So, in this moment, use all the information that you wrote about yourself and create this curriculum vitae. You can share in the discussion board your image of your curriculum vitae and remember that at this point you can start working on your professional portfolio.
Professional portfolios are made of all the projects that you have created, so this ones show everyone everything that you can do and your skills.

So, in the next video I'm going to start showing you how to prepare yourself for a job interview.




<br>
<br>
<br>

## <a name="clase6"> 06 - Preparing yourself for a job interview </a>

Hello again.
In the last video, we created your CV. Now it's time to start preparing for a job interview.
And it's true that sometimes interviews can be a little scary and intimidating. But if you prepare yourself you are going to find this task a lot more easier.

This video has a listening exercise, so be prepared to take notes and answer some questions.

For the first part you need to be aware of your strengths and your weaknesses. 
Also you need to prepare your wardrobe and you need to visualize yourself in the job interview.

So, the first thing that we are going to do is to create the list of strengths and weaknesses.

In my personal case, my ```strengths``` are:

  + **Teamwork**
  + **Sociable**
  + **Organized**
  + **Goal-oriented**
  + **Creative**
  
And my ```weaknesses``` are:

  + **Details**
  + **Too many tasks**
  + **Sensitive**
  
But is necessary for us to explain in more detail what this means.
So, prepare for the listening exercises.

So, here are the instructions for this listening exercise. 

First, you need to:

  + Listen and take notes
  + Read and compare it with your notes
  
There are two parts in this listening exercise. The first one is concentrated on strengths and the second one on weaknesses.

## Strength Exercise:
  
My notes: 
  
  > I think one of my strengths is that I am very good at teamwork. I can help people be organized, I support my team and I make sure everyone does their its task.
  
  > I think one of my strengths is that I am very sociable. I get along with people and they feel confortable with me.
  
  > I consider that I am very organized. I know the tasks that are pending, I organize my days with my tasks in mind. I try to keep lists of the things I need to do.

Here you have the text for the listening exercise. Compare it to the notes that you took.


## Weaknesses Exercise:

Ok, so now, lets go to the second part of this listening exercise. Remember that this one is focused in my weaknesses, so again, listen and take notes. And then, read and compare.

For weaknesses:

  > I consider that sometimes, details can be difficult, especially when I have long workflows. 
  
  > Sometimes I work on too many things at the same time, and it becomes hard.
  
  > When I have too much stress, I sometimes get too sensitive.

Now, read and compare your notes with the text.

#

All right, now you know what your strengths and weaknesses are. It is time for you to visualize yourself in your job interview.
So here I give you some questions that you can answer to prepare for this job interview:

  + When do you feel confident?
    + In my case I feel confident when I know about the topic.

  + What are your qualities?
     + In my case, my qualities are; I am very sociable, I am creative and I am very proactive.

  + Why do you think this company needs you?
    + In my case I think the company needs me because I know about pedagogy and curricular design.
 
  + How can you exceed the position expectations?
    + I think that I can exceed the position expectations because I know a lot about pedagogy and I can teach a lot of people to replicate those things.
    
So, the task for this video is going to have two parts:

  + Create your own list of strengths and weaknesses. 
    - Remember to be descriptive; tell us why do you think this are your strengths and you weaknesses.
  
  + Answer the questions:

    - _When do you feel confident?_
    - _What are your qualities?_
    - _Why do you think this company needs you?_
    - _How can you exceed the position expectations?_
    
Live your answers in the discussion board and remember that everyone is going to give you feedback.



## Task

    + Ordered and detailer
    + Logical and pragmatic

    + Goal-oriented
    + If you're going to do something, do it well

  + **Weaknesses**
    + Obsessive
    + Perfectionism
    + Details can make me lose focus
   
Questions: 

  + **When do you feel confident?**
    > I feel confident when I know I have experience in what I'm doing. But I feel confident too when I have new defies.
    
  + **What are your qualities?**

> **Nicole:** Ok, thank you. So how do you think you can exceed the position expectations?

## <a name="clase9">09 - Vocabulary for the workplace</a>

Communications in the workplace can be tricky, however you can always follow these tips to understand the best ways to interact with coworkers, clients, providers and of course your boss. In this article we are not talking only about digital communication, but all kinds of communication. For this reason, it is necessary that you pay attention to all the people involved, the way in which the message is sent and how it might be received, the context where the message is sent, the channel you choose to send the message, amongst other aspects.

When communicating with people in the work environment it is necessary to consider who you are talking to. It is different if you are talking to your boss than to a colleague that you consider your friend. Additionally, you need to be careful with the channel that you select. Using email might be perceived as more formal than using chat. Paying attention to the context in which you are speaking or sending the message is also relevant for the way people understand.

Asking questions might also be something challenging, especially for new employees. In certain occasions getting used to the **company’s way of communicating** could be intimidating. Nonetheless, asking questions is a skill that all employees need to develop. There are different types of questions you can ask according to the situation. There are direct questions, which are simple and basic, it is truly something you do not know. Also, there are control questions, which are more oriented to confirm something that you already know, sometimes they clarify if the person is uninformed or lying. You can ask summary questions which are more focused on verifying you have understood all the information. Remember not to ask unnecessary questions, so always evaluate if they are relevant and pertinent.

In sum, having successful communications depends on several aspects like knowing the people you are communicating to, the context in which you are involved, the message you need to deliver, the channel you select, the person who receives the message, the pertinence of the message, and the importance of asking the necessary questions. Always try to evaluate the way in which you communicate, and you will be able to be more successful and assertive.

## <a name="clase10">10 - Good strategies for writing in the workplace</a>

In the previous reading, you learned about why is it important to communicate in the workplace. In this video we are going to concentrate on writing and how to improve your writing in the workplace.

For this, we are going to analyze three structures:

  + The first one is emails
  + The second one is reports
  + And the third one is chats
  
### How to write emails?

  Is important to take into account that people do not always have a lot of time to read your emails. So, every time that you write one, you need to be concise and short.
  I'm going to show you two examples of emails and we are going to decide which one is effective and which one is not.
  
  The first one is very very long email. As I told you, people is not ready to read this long information. It's better that you summarize your information and give it in small chunks.
  
  In the next one we have a better example of an effective email. Here you can see that this is short, it's concize and it's divided in to little chunks. 
  
  Now, how to write an email?
  What steps can we follow in order to do it? 

  Before that, I need you to take into account that sometimes we want to say a lot of things, but this things that we want to say are not always relevant, so we need to find a balance between what is it that we want to say and the things that are relevant for the person that is receiving the email. 

  Here we have this steps:
  
  + Select a subject: Be clear and concise: 
    _for instance in my example would be:_ Tasks and deadlines.
    
  + Greet according to the profile of the recipient.
    It's not the same if you are writing to the president of the company or to a CEO of a company, or if you are writing to one of your close clolleges.
  
  + Explain the purpose of the email in the first part.
    Here we have an example: 'I’m writing to you to remind you of the pending tasks and their deadlines.'
 
  + The next part is very important: Write bullets to list the information. This means try to summarize the information in small chunks.
  Here I give you some: 
    + Determine the project’s budget.
    + Select the team for the project.
    + Arrange a meeting to go over plans.
    
  + Finally, you need to include a (_Write a_) goodbye line. 
    Here I'm using: 'Look forward to hearing from you, Paula.'
   
  Of course that there are many other options that you can use. And in the file section you are going to find a list of some of the expressions that you can use throughout emails.
  The most important thing here is to have a clear structure and be as concise as possible.
  
  So, here we have an example that can be useful for you in order to create your own emails.

Example:

>Subject: Website Project
Hello dear David,
I’m writing you to inform you about our meeting next week. In this
meeting I hope we can go over the details of the project:
- Branding
- Landing pages
- Payment system
So, see you next Monday at my office 795 Folsom St, 11:00 am.
Regards,
Paula

The first is the subject and here we use: "Website project". Then we have a greeting line that is: "Hello David" or "Hellow dear David", it shows a little bit of closeness. And then the body of the email.

>I’m writing you to inform you about our meeting next week. In this
meeting I hope we can go over the details of the project:
- Branding
- Landing pages
- Payment system
So, see you next Monday at my office 795 Folsom St, 11:00 am.
Regards,
Paula

  As you can see here are the reset different goodbye line, but still the structure is the same. So all of this expressions you can use them and here I present to you some others useful expressions.

  Useful email expressions

  + If you are introducing the email: I’m writing to inform you… / I’m emailing you to..
  + If you are answering questions: I hope this clarifies your doubts
  + If you want the recipient to do something: I would appreciate if you…
  + If you are expecting an answer: Look forward to hearing from you.
  + If you have been waiting for an answer: In reference to my email on July 20th

  All of this expressions you can use them according to the necessities that you have in the email that you are writing.

### How to write reports

  Now, as I told you, the second part it's related to reports.
  Wherever you are, in a work place environment, you are going to be needed to present reports. 
  So what is the structure of a good report?
  
  First you need to take into account that people need to understand the data of the report that you are presenting.
  Focus on data and statistics. Additionally be able to explain, first the introduction of the report and then the conclusions that you drew from this report.
    
   Whenever you are presenting a report using this types of expressions is going to help you to be clear and to explain in more detail what is it that you did.

When giving reports the following expressions are very useful:

  If you want to assert something:
  + Argue, assert, claim
  
  If you want to show conclusions:
  + Discover, find, conclude

  If you want to show findings:
  + Demonstrate, prove, test

  If you want to compare:
  + Given that x is significantly higher than y…

  So, the important thing is that; first, you identify what is the structure that you have for the report and then you can start using usefull expressions to make it more clear.
  
  Finally, we have: 
  
### How to interact in chats

 And here I want you to think that chats are a little bit more informal that other types of channels, for this reazon you can use different expressions that are more common in informal communication.

  **Here you have some examples of chats:**
  When communicating at work via chat you can shorten messages through the use of expressions such as:
    + A.s.a.p. = "As soon as possible."
    + Idk = "I don't know"
    + FYI = "For your information"
    + BRB ="Be right back"
    + OT = "Off the topic"
    +Thx or Thks = "Thanks"
    
  There are many many many ways to write in chats in a shorten way. And as I told you, in the glosary this information will be expanded so you can have more ideas on how to implement this in the communications that you have via chat.
  
  To finish this video, I would like you to write an email in which you apply to a job position. 
  The idea is that you recycle not just the expressions that we learned in this lesson but also the expressions that you learnt in the previous units. The idea is that you can talk to about yourself and describe yourself using all this vocabulary.
  Remember to be concise and short and also you can share it in the discussion board where we all will be checking your email and giving you feedback.
